# landingPagePractice
This is a landing page about coffee.
I learned many things during this project alone, things that make me want to improve each day more.

# What i learned! 
I learned how to make an entire website from scratch, but the main things that i had to search were!

*border radius.
*how to use all of the width of a page.
*how to center a div

# Final results
I have now realised that i can do everything i want, and that i dont need to question my abilities or the lack of them ever again.
I can become a developer in no time.
